# Wine-Quality-central-Tendency-Case-Study-Project

This project is an analysis of the central tendency of wine quality ratings. The dataset used in this project contains information on various physicochemical properties of different types of wines, as well as a quality rating based on sensory data.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 12 variables and 4898 observations.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to investigate the central tendency of wine quality ratings and identify any potential trends or patterns in the data. This analysis will be conducted using various statistical measures and visualizations.

## Files Included

wine_quality_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis

wine-quality.csv: Dataset used in the analysis

README.md: This file

## Libraries Used
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

## Results
The analysis of the wine quality ratings revealed that the mean quality rating was 5.8, with a standard deviation of 0.87. The median quality rating was 6.0, and the mode was 6.0 as well. There were no significant differences in central tendency between red and white wines.

Additionally, the analysis showed that there were no strong correlations between any of the physicochemical properties and wine quality ratings.

## Conclusion
Overall, the analysis suggests that wine quality ratings tend to cluster around a central value of 6.0, with relatively low variability. This finding could have implications for wine production and marketing strategies.
